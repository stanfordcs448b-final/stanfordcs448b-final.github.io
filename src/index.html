        <h1>How to not get stuck at <span class="airportInTitle">MDW</span></h1>

        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 300;">Explore flight delays and their causes!</p>
        <p>
            A few months ago, I (Isaac) bought tickets to fly from Salt Lake to Richmond to visit my parents.
            After years spent in Utah Valley’s desert, I looked forward to the walks in my hometown’s forests, summer rains,
            and Virginian oysters that characterize my hometown. My travels that day were supposed to be light, with just one small layover.
            <br><br>
            The airports had other plans for me. One slightly delayed flight led to a missed connection in Chicago,
            sprints from terminal to service desk to terminal, hours on the phone, and ultimately the worst airport experience of my life.
            Four airports and 21 hours later, I touched down in Norfolk’s small airport.
            <br><br>
            In my case, a 15 minute delay meant the difference between an 8 hour trip and a 21 hour trip.
            <br><br>
            In 2024, <span class="emphasizedRed">1.4 million</span> American domestic flights were delayed by at least 15 minutes.
            <span class="emphasizedRed">21.7%</span> of all domestic flights were either cancelled or delayed.
            These delays alone caused around <span class="emphasizedRed">185 million hours</span> of wasted passenger time,
            let alone the time spent recovering from the disturbance.
            <br><br>
            At least in my family, Chicago’s two main airports are legendary for their volatility.
            We tell horror stories around the campfire about days lost to its endless delays and queues.

            Midway did only a touch worse than the national average in 2024!
            <br><br>
            The worst large airport for delays was Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) with a whopping <span class="emphasizedRed">29.4%</span> delay rate,
            followed closely by Dallas Fort Worth International (DFW) airport at <span class="emphasizedRed">28.8%</span>.
            (For our purposes, we only count flight cancellations and departure delays that take longer than 15 minutes).
            <br><br>
            If you’re planning around flight delays, other factors matter beyond your airport of origin.
            Consider destination airport. For instance, <span class="emphasizedRed">54.0%</span> of 2024’s flights from BWI to Oakland were delayed,
            but only <span class="emphasizedBlue">21.2%</span> of the flights from Baltimore to San Jose were delayed, even though both destination airports are in the Bay area.</p>

            Bigger airports have slightly more delays than smaller airports on average,
            (<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: italic;">R</span> = 0.34),
            so if you need to make a connecting flight during a busy time of the year,
            it might be worth paying a little more for a ticket that avoids the largest airports.

            Delays often propagate; a late flight in the morning can cause another late afternoon flight.
            Evening flights are more than twice as likely to be delayed as morning flights.
            <br><br>
            Once your flight’s been pushed back by 15 minutes, you can expect to be waiting for over an hour.
            Not all delays are created equal; delays caused by weather average a <span class="emphasizedRed">93 minute</span> wait time, 
            while security delays average <span class="emphasizedBlue">38 minutes</span>.
